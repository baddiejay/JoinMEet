First group project realized in Prolog by me and my classmates Simone Damiano and Maria Antonietta De Carlo for the Artificial Intelligence course at Federico II university, year 2019/2020

The project wanted to reproduce in prolog an online dating mechanism, where each user enters information about their interests and the system matches people with similar interests or characteristics.
